This will all you to take an action replay for a Sega saturn and solder it to the under side of the cart connector to bypass a bad slot.

This currently is setup to work with VA 0 and .5 motherboards I belive it will work with VA1 but do not have a system to test with. in the future I'ld like to make the same board or possibly a few boards for all revisions.




## Features

- Enable / Disable with a switch
- Swap between Action Replay and Pseudo Saturn Kai https://ppcenter.webou.net/pskai/
- If PAL equations can be extracted this could be buildable without buying an action replay 



## Parts Needed
- PCBs
- Action Replay
- Slodering skills
## Building

1. Order Boards from a PCB supplier
2. Disamble an Action replay and assembnle on new board
3. Solder to underside of card slot
## Help Wanted
